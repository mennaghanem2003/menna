            <h2>Equity = Fairness</h2>
            <p>
                Equity means ensuring that everyone gets what they need to have an equal chance at success. It takes into account the diverse backgrounds and challenges individuals may have. By providing additional support and resources to those who require them, equity promotes fairness and equal outcomes.

            <h3>Defination Of Equality</h3>
            <h2>Equality = Sameness
            </h2>
            <p>
                EEquality means providing the same opportunities and resources to all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. It aims to treat everyone equally and promote justice. However, it may not address the unique needs and challenges that some individuals face.

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>Imagine a school that practices equality. It provides the same textbooks, facilities, and teachers to all students. However, some students may have learning disabilities or come from disadvantaged backgrounds, making it difficult for them to succeed with only equal resources. On the other hand, a school that practices equity would provide additional resources such as tutoring or individualized support to students who need it, ensuring that all students have an equal opportunity to thrive academically.
